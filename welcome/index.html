<h1 id="welcome-to-umass">Welcome to UMass!</h1>
<p>On behalf of the UMass Department of Philosophy, I want to begin by
extending you a warm welcome. We are really happy to have you
aboard.</p>
<p>The purpose of this site is to provide you with some important
information you need to know as a graduate student in our program and to
point you where you can find more information if needed. I’ve also
included some additional information you may find useful as you prepare
to begin your time at UMass.</p>
<p>The amount of information you will find here might seem overwhelming,
but it really is important, and some of it essential to such things as
getting paid and accessing the building. So please take your time to go
over it and do not hesitate to reach out with any questions you may
have. <a href="./people">This page</a> should give you a good sense of
who to ask about various topics, but feel free to ask me anything.</p>
<p>I recommend you start by looking at the <a
href="./checklists.html">checklists</a>. Each item on those lists
contains links to additional information about each of the tasks, so
that rather than reading everything on this page, you can just take one
task at a time.</p>
<p>In addition to the items on the checklists, all of which amount to
tasks you definitely need to do either before the start of the school
year or before the end of the first week of classes, I have put together
a page with <a href="./misc.html">additional information</a> you may
find helpful as you prepare your move to Amherst, including some
information about <a href="./misc.html#housing">housing</a>.</p>
<p>Fall semester begins on <strong>Tuesday, September 3th</strong>, but
you should <strong>make sure to arrive in the area a week or more before
that</strong>. You are expected on campus for a departmental orientation
event on <strong>Wednesday, August 28th</strong>. In addition, there is
a Graduate School orientation event on Friday, August 30th that I
encourage all of you to attend. International students are also required
to attend an additional orientation event on Thursday, August 29th.
Finally, note that we will be hosting a start-of-the-year Departmental
meeting, most likely on <strong>Friday, September 6th</strong>, which I
very much hope all of you can attend. We will “introduce” each of you to
the rest of the department at this meeting. Check your email for the
exact date, time and location.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you as you make this important transition.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Alejandro</p>
