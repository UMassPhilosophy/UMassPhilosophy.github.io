<h1 id="for-international-students">For International Students</h1>
<p>You should have already begun working with the International
Programs Office (IPO) to complete your I-20 and obtain your visa. If
you haven’t yet, you should start as soon as possible. You can find
contact information on
the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/ipo/iss">IPO’s website</a>.</p>
<p>Please defer to IPO in matters pertaining to your visa and
immigration; they can tell you what documents are necessary, and when
and how to submit them. The IPO’s website also contains a lot of other
information that may be useful to international students. They also
publish a handbook for International Students, which you can
find <a href="https://www.umass.edu/ipo/sites/default/files/UMass%20IPO%20International%20Student%20Handbook.pdf"
class="uri">here</a>.</p>
<p>You should be aware that the process of obtaining a visa can be
time-consuming and complicated, and may involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arranging a consular visit to obtain your visa and immigration
paperwork.</li>
<li>Providing your immunization record, either at the consulate or at
the border when entering. Make sure your vaccinations are up to date.
(It is possible you will be allowed to catch up on vaccinations after
arrival; this can be done
through <a href="https://www.umass.edu/uhs/">University Health
Services, UHS</a>.)</li>
<li>Demonstrating a certain amount of financial assets to obtain your
I-20 in excess of the amount of money UMass pays (tuition waiver plus
fellowship or TA-ship). Typically this ranges from $3000–$8000 that
you will need to show in your bank account. (After approval it needn’t
remain there.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you contact the consulate, you should make sure that both
the tuition waiver and any fellowship/TA-ship are reflected on your
I-20.</p>
<p>You will also need to fill out tax information through the
University’s GLACIER tax system. You should receive an email
from <a href="https://www.umass.edu/humres/">Human Resources (HR)</a>
about this. Every country has its own tax agreement with the U.S. (the
amount withheld will vary by country). HR can help you with filling
out the form.</p>
<p>International students receiving fellowship money need an
international tax identification number (ITIN). (A social security
number, SSN, is only needed for TAs/TOs.) You will need to go through
IPO for the ITIN, with the help of the University Controller’s Office.
This process takes a long time, so get on this ASAP by talking to IPO.
Beth can also help direct you. You will need your Visa, I-20, most
recent I-94, and your passport. Note that the Controller’s Office is
not on campus. Their website is
here: <a href="https://www.umass.edu/controller/"
class="uri">https://www.umass.edu/controller/</a></p>
<p>Contact the IPO, HR and/or Beth with any questions throughout this
process.</p>
