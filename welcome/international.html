<h1 id="for-international-students">For International Students</h1>
<p>You should have already begun working with the International
Student &amp; Scholar Services (ISSS) to complete your I-20 and obtain
your visa. If you haven’t yet, you should start as soon as possible.
You can find contact information on
the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/global-affairs/international-students-scholars">ISSS’s
website</a>.</p>
<p>Please defer to ISSS in matters pertaining to your visa and
immigration; they can tell you what documents are necessary, and when
and how to submit them. The ISSS’s website also contains a lot of other
  <a href="https://www.umass.edu/global-affairs/international-students-scholars/resources">information
  that may be useful</a> to international students. </p>
<p>You should be aware that the process of obtaining a visa can be
time-consuming and complicated, and may involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arranging a consular visit to obtain your visa and immigration
paperwork.</li>
<li>Providing your immunization record, either at the consulate or at
the border when entering. Make sure your vaccinations are up to date.
(It is possible you will be allowed to catch up on vaccinations after
arrival; this can be done
through <a href="https://www.umass.edu/uhs/">University Health
Services, UHS</a>.)</li>
<li>Demonstrating a certain amount of financial assets to obtain your
I-20 in excess of the amount of money UMass pays (tuition waiver plus
fellowship or TA-ship). Typically this ranges from $3000–$8000 that
you will need to show in your bank account. (After approval it needn’t
remain there.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you contact the consulate, you should make sure that both
the tuition waiver and any fellowship/TA-ship are reflected on your
I-20.</p>
<h2 id="taxes-finances">Taxes and finances</h2>
<p>As an international student, you will also need
  to <a href="https://www.umass.edu/global-affairs/international-students-scholars/resources/financial-health">file
  taxes</a>. You should receive an email
  from <a href="https://www.umass.edu/humres/">Human Resources
  (HR)</a> about getting access
  to <a href="https://www.umassp.edu/nonresident-alien-taxation/access-sprintax-tax-preparation-software">Sprintax</a>.
  Every country has its own tax agreement with the U.S. (the amount
  withheld will vary by country). HR can help you with filling out the
  form.</p>

<p>You will also need to obtain a Social Security Number (SSN). The Office of Global Affairs has the most up-to-date <a href="https://www.umass.edu/global-affairs/international-students-scholars/resources/basics/social-security">information</a> on how to do that. 
If for some reason you are not yet eligible for a SSN, you will need to obtain a international tax identification number (ITIN). You will need to go through
ISSS for the ITIN, with the help of the University Controller’s Office.
This process takes a long time, so get on this ASAP by talking to ISSS.
Beth can also help direct you. You will need your Visa, I-20, most
recent I-94, and your passport. Note that the Controller’s Office is
not on campus. Their website is
here: <a href="https://www.umass.edu/controller/"
class="uri">https://www.umass.edu/controller/</a></p>
<p>Contact the ISSS, HR and/or Beth with any questions throughout this
  process.</p>
<h2>Preparing for your trip</h2>
<p>The Office of Global Affairs has some helpful <a href="https://www.umass.edu/global-affairs/international-students-scholars/getting-umass-amherst">information</a> for making arrangements for your trip. In particular, if you are flying into Boston, there is a very affordable shuttle service for new international students you can book <a href="https://general-umass.nbsstore.net/umass-express?TSPD_101_R0=0838a9d8d6ab20000904938bb39c1c216e8a0e2543abae0bff4416fab0a54ac2cb82fe12c1a00a1f08c00f275b143000e8afd0f3ca88246f0869eef4954db72823241a77ec49b5e4ae1bde857472fa89b93d5f722f4f262276f40c21b341d51a">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you arrive in the US, you probably will need access to a non-US bank account, at least temporarily. Before you depart for the US, you should make sure to lift any restrictions your bank may place on accessing your funds from abroad, so that you can use your debit or credit card in the US. (For security reasons, some banks put restrictions on where your card can be used from. You can typically remove these restrictions yourself if you use online banking, or by making a quick call to your bank.)</p>

<p>You will most likely require a US-phone number for things like opening a bank account, finishing required HR documents, fully setting up your SPIRE account, etc. Also, roaming fees for the US are typically quite expensive, so it is a good idea to avoid using your home country’s phone number. The Office of Global Affairs has some information <a href="https://www.umass.edu/global-affairs/international-students-scholars/resources/basics/banks">on this page</a> about ways of getting a US SIM card as an international student, even before you arrive in the US.</p>
