<h1
id="departmental-and-university-procedures-and-policies">Departmental
and University Procedures and Policies</h1>
<p>As a graduate student in the Department, you are expected to be
familiar with the program’s <a
href="https://www.umass.edu/philosophy/graduate-regulations/administration">regulations</a>.
It is thus advisable that you read over them before the beginning of
your first year and that you contact your advisor or the GPD if you have
any questions about them.</p>
<p>In addition to the official regulations, there are a few Departmental
and University policies and procedures you should be aware of.</p>
<h2 id="email"><a name="email"></a> Email</h2>
<p>Each incoming student will be provided with an University email
account. It is crucial that you monitor this account on a regular basis,
as that is the address that will be used by the Department and the
University for all official communication. (If you prefer, you can have
all emails sent to your UMass account <a
href="https://www.umass.edu/it/support/google-apps/google-mail-faq#Can%20I%20set%20up%20Google%20Mail%20to%20forward%20messages%20to%20a%20different%20email%20address?">forwarded
to another account</a>.)</p>
<p>Your UMass email address has been or soon will be added to our
graduate student mailing list: <a
href="mailto:philos-all-grad@groups.umass.edu">philos-all-grad@groups.umass.edu</a></p>
<p>Messages sent to that address should reach all the students in the
program.</p>
<h2 id="office-assignments-keys-and-mailboxes"><a name="office"></a>
Office assignments, keys, and mailboxes</h2>
<p>You will be sharing an office with one or more other graduate
students. The assignments will be sent out in July to the graduate
student mailing list.</p>
<p>Once you pick up your UCard, let Beth Know so she can request as door
access to the building, which is needed to enter South College in the
evening and on weekends, when it’s closed to visitors.</p>
<p>Every graduate student is also assigned a mailbox in the Philosophy
Department’s copier/mail room in E305 South College. It is important
that you check this on a regular basis. Any Department member can tell
you the access code to the room (for when the door is
closed/locked).</p>
<h2 id="registering-for-classes"><a name="registering"></a> Registering
for classes</h2>
<p>You should enroll in courses as soon as possible, because this is
needed to trigger the mechanisms that lead to your financial aid. You
can change your courses without penalty until the end of add/drop so
your choices need not be final. Registration continues through Monday,
September 16th, 2024, the final day of the add/drop period.</p>
<p>All first-year students
are <a href="https://www.umass.edu/philosophy/graduate-regulations/preliminary-requirements#proseminar">required
to take the Proseminar</a> (Philosophy 700) during the Fall of their
first year. Typically, students take five other courses during their
their first year, or sometimes six if they are not teaching during
their first two semesters. We strongly encourage you to discuss your
choice of courses with your advisor or the GPD by the end of the first
week of classes.</p>
<p>A <a
href="https://www.umass.edu/philosophy/graduate-courses">list of
philosophy graduate courses for Fall 2025</a> can be found on the
Department website under “Graduate Courses”.</p>
<p>In order to enroll in courses, you need to make use of SPIRE. The
Graduate School provides information on enrollment <a
href="https://www.umass.edu/graduate/handbook/enrollment"
title="enrollment">here</a> and <a
href="https://www.umass.edu/graduate/policies/registration"
title="registration">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contracts"><a name="contract"></a> Contracts</h2>
<p>Whether or not you are employed by the university this coming
semester, you must agree to the <em>Terms and Conditions</em> online. To
do this, you must log on to <a
href="https://www.spire.umass.edu">SPIRE</a> using the student role and
click <strong>Graduate Employment Terms</strong> in the <em>To Do
List</em> details. You must make sure that your browser security
settings allow pop-ups on SPIRE.</p>
<p>If you are receiving a fellowship, Beth will complete your fellowship
contract before July 1st. Please check your UMass email to watch for her
email requesting your signature on the contract which can be done
electronically. International students are not required to sign the
contract, but she will forward a copy of the completed contract for your
records.</p>
<p>You will need to enroll in Excess Express through your SPIRE
financials page (using a <a href="../misc#banking">bank account</a>) to
be eligible to receive your funding as a direct deposit to your
bank.</p>
<p>New TAs/TOs must complete the HR hiring packet <em>at least two weeks
prior</em> to the start of the semester to receive paychecks. The packet
and instructions for completing it are available here:</p>

class="uri">https://www.umass.edu/hr/documents/hiring-forms-new-graduate-student-employees</a></p>
<h2 id="tuition-waivers-and-bills"><a name="bills"></a> Tuition waivers
and bills</h2>
<p>Most forms of funding offered by the Department (fellowships,
most TA/TO-ships) carry tuition waivers with them.</p>
<p>You will get a bill from the Bursar’s Office. <em>Do not pay it
immediately.</em> It takes a while for your tuition waiver to be applied
to your account and for you to get your funding. If you have any
questions about your bill ask Beth first before contacting the Bursar’s
office.</p>
