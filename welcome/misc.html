</ul>
<p>Some additional links you may find helpful are available on <a
href="./links.html">this page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="housing"><a name="housing"></a>Housing</h2>
<p>Living costs vary widely depending on how and where you live. A
number of graduate students live in Northampton (which is pretty
expensive), but others live in Amherst, South Hadley, Hadley, Holyoke,
Greenfield, Easthampton, etc. You may want to start your search of
housing by emailing the current student mailing
list: <a href="mailto:philos-all-grad@groups.umass.edu">philos-all-grad@groups.umass.edu</a>.
Current students are often aware of places that are coming up for
rent.</p>
<p>The University offers assistance on housing through a couple of
different offices. The main place is the Office of Housing and Residence
Life. A lot of apartments and rooms are posted on their website at <a
href="https://offcampushousing.umass.edu/"
class="uri">https://offcampushousing.umass.edu/</a></p>
<!-- <p>On-campus housing can be sought through Residential Life Student -->
<!-- Services, 235 Whitmore, phone (413) 545-2100. The website is: <a -->
<!-- href="https://www.umass.edu/living/" -->
<!-- class="uri">https://www.umass.edu/living/</a>. Family Housing is handled -->
<!-- at North Village and can be accessed through the same URL. Their phone -->
<!-- number is (413) 545-3115.</p> -->
<p>Other resources for finding housing include local newspapers and on
  bulletin boards. Some online sites to check include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://westernmass.craigslist.org/">Craigslist for Western Massachusetts</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.rentnoho.com/">Rent Noho</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.robinsonre.com/">Robinson Real Estate Service</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Potential landlords may ask for a credit report, references from previous landlords, and other documentation. <strong>If you are an international student</strong>, do let your potential landlord know that: they may be willing to waive these requirements for you, especially if they have experience hosting international students.</p>

<h2 id="travel-information"><a name="travel"></a>Travel information</h2>
<p>The closest major airport is Bradley International Airport (BDL),
near Hartford, Connecticut. From there you can get a taxi, Uber, or
shuttle.</p>
<p>If you are coming from somewhere reasonably close by (e.g. somewhere
in the Northeastern U.S.), you may want to consider taking a bus or a
train. Peter Pan buses (<a href="https://peterpanbus.com"
class="uri">https://peterpanbus.com</a>) come right to campus; Amtrak
trains (<a href="https://amtrak.com" class="uri">https://amtrak.com</a>)
come to Northampton.</p>
<p>Some additional information you may find helpful as you prepare your
move is available on the Office of Parents Services area guide (<a
href="https://www.umass.edu/parents/visiting-amherst"
class="uri">https://www.umass.edu/parents/visiting-amherst</a>). It
includes information about visitor parking, a list of local hotels,
transportation resources (including information about shuttles to and
from the nearest airports), as well as aa list of local ATMs,
convenience stores, auto-repair garages, restaurants, etc.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-and-health-insurance"><a name="insurance"></a>Benefits
and health insurance</h2>
<p>Massachusetts and US residents are required to have health insurance,
and international students are required to hold the University’s health
plan. If it is not part of your benefits package, you must purchase a
plan. Information on the plan, called the Student Health Benefit Plan
(SHBP), can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.umass.edu/uhs/insurance/shbp"
class="uri">https://www.umass.edu/uhs/insurance/shbp</a></p>
<p>Domestic students are welcome to consider other options. For this,
the Massachusetts Health Connector may be useful:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mahealthconnector.org/"
class="uri">https://www.mahealthconnector.org/</a></p>
<p>Members of the Graduate Employee Organization (GEO, a union)
bargaining get a very significant discount on the SHBP. GEO members also
have access to other benefits, such as dental, vision, childcare and
wellness benefits. To be a member, you must be considered an
<em>employee</em> of the University. This includes TAs/TOs in the
Department.</p>
<h2 id="parking"><a name="parking"></a>Parking</h2>
<p>If you plan to drive a car onto campus regularly, you will need a
parking permit from Parking Services (<a
href="https://parking.umass.edu"
class="uri">https://parking.umass.edu</a>). The Parking Services office
is located in Lot 25 past the Mullins Center. Metered lots are also
available throughout campus.</p>
<h2 id="banking"><a name="banking"></a>Banking</h2>
<p>In order to get paid, you will need an American bank account. Common
banks in the area include <a
href="https://www.td.com/us/en/personal-banking/">TD Bank</a>, <a
href="https://www.greenfieldsavings.com/">Greenfield Savings Bank</a>,
<a href="https://www.bankatpeoples.com/home/home">People’s Bank</a>, <a
href="https://www.florencebank.com/">Florence Bank</a>, <a
href="https://www.bankesb.com/">Easthampton Savings Bank</a>, <a
href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a>, and the <a
href="https://www.umassfive.coop/">UMassFive College Credit Union</a>.
You will need an American address to open an account, so you may need to
wait until you’ve secured a place in order to open an account: you will probably need to bring a signed copy of your lease in order to open an account.</p>

<p>Note that in order to open a bank account online, you typically need to list your Social Security Number (SSN). If you are an <strong>international student</strong>, you probably don’t have one. Most banks allow you to open an account without a SSN, but this typically requires you to make an in-person appointment with them. Reach out to banks beforehand to make an appointment and make sure to bring all required documents.</p>
<p>Once you have a bank account, enroll in Excess Express on your
financials page in SPIRE: <a
href="https://www.umass.edu/bursar/refunds-and-excess-express"
class="uri">https://www.umass.edu/bursar/refunds-and-excess-express</a></p>
