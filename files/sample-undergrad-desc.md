### 100.01 | Introduction to Philosophy

This course is an introduction to philosophy. In particular, it is an introduction to some of the main issues that have preoccupied humans for thousands of years, as well as an introduction to a distinctive way of thinking about these and other issues: a way of thinking that focuses on carefully presenting and evaluating arguments. No background is assumed or required. By the end of the course, I hope that each of you will think of yourself as a philosopher---as someone who thinks hard about philosophical questions, using philosophical methods, at least some of the time. Thinking about such questions, and using such methods, I humbly suggest, will make your life better, in a wide variety of ways. Some of these ways are mundane and practical. (Thinking like a philosopher will help you with your writing, analytic thinking, and communicating, which in turn will help you perform better in almost any career; and it will also help you to get better scores on the GRE, LSAT, MCAT, and GMAT.) And some of the ways in which thinking like a philosopher will make your life better are deeper and harder to measure. (Doing so will help you think through issues about what is meaningful and valuable, for example, and who you are, and how you should live your life.) The course will cover topics in Epistemology, Philosophy of Mind, Metaphysics, Philosophical Theology, and Moral Philosophy. We will focus especially on the following questions: What can I know about the external world? What exactly am I---do I have an immaterial soul, or am I purely physical? Do I have free will? Is there a God? What makes right actions right? Does any of this matter? The aim of the course will be to educate students about some of the main issues, theses, and arguments concerning these topics, so that the students may arrive at their own considered opinions on these matters.

### 100H | Introduction to Philosophy (Honors)

An introduction to Western philosophy through the examination of one of the most influential philosophical books ever written: Descartes' _Meditations on First Philosophy_. Topics include the nature and existence of the self, the existence of God, the nature of bodies, the relation of cause and effect, knowledge that is independent of sense experience, and skepticism about the external world. An underlying sub-theme of the course is: skepticism. Accordingly, we will also study texts by two skeptical philosophers: Gournay's _The Equality of Men and Women_ and Hume's _Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_. We will explore sceptical challenges to the view that "women are by nature intellectually inferior to men" (Gournay), that the senses reveal metaphysical truth (Descartes), and that our inductive practices are rationally justifiable (Hume). The beginning of the course will focus on the structure of philosophical arguments and we'll master some tools for evaluating them. Students will use their skills in textual interpretation and argument analysis in the one-page, weekly reflection assignments; the final take-home essay; in-class tests, and the short class presentation. Given the importance of the texts, the depth and breadth of topics covered, the focus on critical reasoning, and the stress on written and verbal expression, this course meets the objectives of the General Education (Arts and Literature) curriculum. This is a 4-credit course and is open solely to Commonwealth College Honors students.

(This course is restricted to Commonwealth College first-year students.)

**Note**: Once first-year students have registered, in late June, this class will be opened to other Commonwealth College students.

*Description forthcoming.*

### 105 | Practical Reasoning

This course covers methods for understanding and evaluating reasoning, arguments and inferences, of the sort found in daily life, political speeches, academic writing and beyond. We address such questions as: What is the structure of an argument? What considerations are relevant for determining its strength and cogency? What sorts of appeals to quantitative and scientific data are appropriate, and what sorts aren’t? What, if any, kinds of reasoning patterns can be identified as fallacious or abusive? How can we understand and overcome cognitive biases?

### 166 | Environmental Ethics

What is your relationship to the natural environment? More importantly, what should your relationship be? In this class, we will engage with the issues of population growth and resource use, biodiversity loss and sustainability, non-human animal welfare, environmental justice, and global climate change. We will examine these issues through grappling with the following distinctively ethical questions: (a) is nature just for humans to use? (b) how should we understand the value of nature? (c) what is the moral status of non-human animals, and how should we take their welfare into account in our lives? (d) how should we think about inequitable environmental access?; (e) what should you and I do about climate change?

### 320 | History of Ancient Philosophy

History of Ancient Philosophy is a survey course that explores why the ancient Greeks are considered the founders of Western Philosophy.  Starting with pre-Socratic rational cosmology, we will see the advent of inquiry guided by reason and argumentation rather than prophetic testimony.  With Socrates, we will see the turn to definition, with a focus on morality and the good life; and in Plato’s Republic we will follow a sustained account of justice, human psychology, politics, and the nature of knowledge and reality.  Finally, with Aristotle we will see the birth of virtue ethics (the idea that what makes an action good is the state of character behind it), the philosophy of science, and a return to rational cosmology.

*Prerequisites*: credit for one course taken in the UMass Philosophy Department.

### 342 | Introduction to Epistemology

Some beliefs are justified; some are not. What are the standards that a belief must meet if it is to count as justified? We will begin this course by looking at three different answers to this question: foundationalism; the coherence theory; and reliabilism. After discussing each of these views in some detail and examining their merits and deficiencies, we will go on to look at a number of applications of these views: to questions about inductive inference; testimony; self-knowledge; and epistemic agency. All readings for the course will be free and available on-line. Written requirements for the course will involve some short papers (three to five pages each), and one longer term paper (10 to 12 pages). Readings from Laurence BonJour, Alvin Goldman, Ernest Sosa, Berislav Marusic, Richard Moran, and a variety of others.

### 355 | Introduction to Philosophy of Mind

Can mere matter think?  What is consciousness?  Can I exist without any body?  How can my intentions cause my body to move?  These are among the questions that constitute the “Mind-Body Problem;” this course will show you how philosophers have tried  solve it.  We’ll begin with a survey of the main theoretical frameworks philosophers have proposed for understanding the relation between mind and body: dualism, reductionism, behaviorism, and functionalism.   Then we’ll examine two or three more specific issues in some detail, drawing on work by contemporary philosophers.

### 391G | History of the Philosophy of Gender

We will examine important texts from the Middle Ages through the French and American Revolutions, which focus on such questions as: How did philosophers theorize gender difference? Did they hold that men's greater physical power justified their subordination of women in society?  Were there theological arguments for men's subordination of women?  How were these arguments criticized? What were the arguments against the education of women, and how were these arguments criticized?  How did human cognitive abilities, such as sense, imagination, and reason, come to be 'gendered'?  Did women typically not take part in the Enlightenment project of scientific inquiry because it was thought they were more deficient in reason than men? Which social roles were deemed appropriate for women, and why?  Which were deemed appropriate for men, and why?  Was it held that the virtues are the same for men and women, or was it argued that there are specifically feminine and masculine virtues?

In the 20th century, theorists began to distinguish gender and biological sex.  It is now held by many that gender is entirely a social construct.  This move does not happen in the period we will look at, the 15th -18th centuries. But we will trace the arguments in this period that attempt to show that many of the theoretical claims about women's 'nature' and men's 'nature' are simply due to custom, habit, and prejudice.  In short, that they are socially constructed. The authors we will examine will be among these figures: Aristotle, Christine de Pisan, Equicola, Castiglione, Gournay, Van Schurman, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Poullain de la Barre, Descartes, Lambert, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, and Sargent Murray.

_Prerequisites_: One previous 5-College philosophy course or permission of the Instructor.

_Requirements_: Class participation in our weekly discussion: the course is structured as a seminar; 2 papers (5-8 pages); and 1 or more (depending on class size) class presentation(s).

### 542 | Topics in Epistemology

This course will be devoted to a discussion of the notion of epistemic agency. To what extent, if at all, is the formation of our beliefs something that we do, rather than something that merely happens to us? Some philosophers think that, although some of belief acquisition is merely passive, we do, at times, play an active role in forming our beliefs. Indeed, for some philosophers, the very idea that we evaluate some of our beliefs as justified, and some as unjustified, presupposes that we are agents with respect to our beliefs: being justified isn’t something that can merely happen to a belief; the belief must have been the product of an action for it to be normatively assessable in this way. There are other ideas about epistemic agency as well, and, of course, some philosophers are dubious that there is such a thing. We will look at a variety of views on this topic, and we will read work by Ernest Sosa, Berislav Marusic, Richard Moran, Kieran Setiya, Pamela Hieronymi, and a variety of others. All of the readings for the course will be available free and on-line. One short paper (about 5 pages), and one longer term paper (about 18 to 20 pages) will be due for the course.

_Prerequisites for undergraduates_: at least three prior philosophy courses or consent of instructor.

### 593C | Counterfactuals

Counterfactual conditionals have played starring role in many philosophical theories, including analyses of causation, dispositions, and knowledge, as well as theories of rational decision making and scientific explanation. We will begin with an overview of some of the now classic accounts of the logic and semantics for counterfactuals, reading work by Lewis, Stalnaker, Kratzer, and Veltman, among others. We will then move on to consider more recent alternatives to the classical treatments of counterfactuals. In particular, we will look at approaches that rely on causal models to provide a semantics for counterfactuals (Galles and Pearl, Hiddleston, Briggs, Halpern), and approaches that appeal to entities more fine-grained than possible worlds (e.g. alternative semantics, inquisitive semantics, and truth-maker semantics---Alonso-Ovalle, Champollion et al., Fine, Kratzer, and Santorio, among others). Depending on the interest of students in the class, we may spend some time on questions about counterfactual reasoning (e.g. how should we assign probabilities to counterfactuals?) and its role in games and decision situations (backward induction arguments, Newcomb's problem, Prisoners Dilemma, etc.). 

*Prerequisites for undergraduates*: at least three prior philosophy courses---including Phil 110 (Introduction to Logic), Phil 310 (Intermediate Logic), or a similar class---or permission of the instructor.
