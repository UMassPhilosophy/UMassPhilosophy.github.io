### 542 | Topics in Epistemology

This course will be devoted to a discussion of the notion of epistemic agency. To what extent, if at all, is the formation of our beliefs something that we do, rather than something that merely happens to us? Some philosophers think that, although some of belief acquisition is merely passive, we do, at times, play an active role in forming our beliefs. Indeed, for some philosophers, the very idea that we evaluate some of our beliefs as justified, and some as unjustified, presupposes that we are agents with respect to our beliefs: being justified isnâ€™t something that can merely happen to a belief; the belief must have been the product of an action for it to be normatively assessable in this way. There are other ideas about epistemic agency as well, and, of course, some philosophers are dubious that there is such a thing. We will look at a variety of views on this topic, and we will read work by Ernest Sosa, Berislav Marusic, Richard Moran, Kieran Setiya, Pamela Hieronymi, and a variety of others. All of the readings for the course will be available free and on-line. One short paper (about 5 pages), and one longer term paper (about 18 to 20 pages) will be due for the course.

### 593C | Counterfactuals

Counterfactual conditionals have played starring role in many philosophical theories, including analyses of causation, dispositions, and knowledge, as well as theories of rational decision making and scientific explanation. We will begin with an overview of some of the now classic accounts of the logic and semantics for counterfactuals, reading work by Lewis, Stalnaker, Kratzer, and Veltman, among others. We will then move on to consider more recent alternatives to the classical treatments of counterfactuals. In particular, we will look at approaches that rely on causal models to provide a semantics for counterfactuals (Galles and Pearl, Hiddleston, Briggs, Halpern), and approaches that appeal to entities more fine-grained than possible worlds (e.g. alternative semantics, inquisitive semantics, and truth-maker semantics---Alonso-Ovalle, Champollion et al., Fine, Kratzer, and Santorio, among others). Depending on the interest of students in the class, we may spend some time on questions about counterfactual reasoning (e.g. how should we assign probabilities to counterfactuals?) and its role in games and decision situations (backward induction arguments, Newcomb's problem, Prisoners Dilemma, etc.).
